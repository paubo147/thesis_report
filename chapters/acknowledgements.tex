\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

There are several people who contributed to the success of this project. 

First of all my supervisor at Ericsson AB, Johan Moe who laid the foundations of the thesis and guided the project in the firm.

Also, the ``Roffe'' team in Ericsson AB, which contributed in several social as well as topic-related aspects. Primarily Bengt Carlsson, who gave all the needed technical information and advice. 

Special thanks goes to Patric Wernqvist, project manager of Ericsson AB, who gave me a deeper insight of the project context.

Finally, my LiU supervisor, Ahmed Rezine, at Link√∂ping University who had the theoretical foundation and access to this topic and my examiner, Kristian Sandahl, who helped me with literature search and gave advice in the working progress. 

Last but not least my family and friends who supported me during the time at Ericsson AB and while writing the thesis.
