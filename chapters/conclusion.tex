\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

As we have seen, using SMT to generate test-cases from a set of constraints on a model which is the one we have seen in Section~\ref{chap:ecim} is challenging and implies a deep theoretical knowledge. We have seen how highly configurable software can be modeled and how configurations can be derived to test them as well as how to use constraints to steer the test-case generation. 

On the other hand, SMT solving provides a comfortable way to delegate decisions to a formal method which is specifically designed for such a task. With the benefit of a comfortable handling there comes the drawback of performance or complexity together with the encoding, which could have an astonishing impact on the running time. However, we believe that there would be some space for improvement by smartly choosing an encoding. \\

The tool is currently still in the stage of testing, but is already partially used on smaller models to generate configurations for the development. It can be assumed that the work will continue and the tool will be completed to a degree to cover the comprehensive functionality of the models. Once this work is done, it is likely that the tool will be included into the build-chain of the current project set-up.
